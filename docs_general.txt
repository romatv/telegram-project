                                    Idea


This telegram bot offers way to download songs from Spotify playlists.
Downloads are limited to 2 per every-week.

                                  Libaries


To obtain this functionality next external libraries are used:
(Note - all versions required are listed in requirements.txt,
to install all use   pip install -r requirements.txt,
if updated, use      pip freeze > requirements.txt)

    requirements.txt

    To install all required dependancies, activate your virtualenv,
    and write next command: pip install -r requirements.txt (or path to requirements.txt file)

    To update and overwrite use: pip freeze > requirements.txt

                                    Logic


a) Ask for a link to user playlist.
b) Create list of all song names from it.
c) Get URL of first video with song name that popped in YouTube search.
d) Download mp4 audio stream of that video into a freshly created folder.
e) Repeat c-d for each song name in a list.
f) Create ZIP-file with all downloaded songs inside.
g) Send this file to the user of Telegram Bot.
h) Delete all downloaded files and folder to optimize storage.

Tasks to complete:
- delete files if download was unsuccessful or broken infinity polling.
- name playlist file as actual playlist name.
- add protection from too many messages sent.
- add protection from infinite playlists. Maybe limit the playlist size to 200 items.
